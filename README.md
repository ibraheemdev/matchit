A high performance, zero-copy URL router.

```rust
use matchit::Router;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut router = Router::new();
    router.insert("/home", "Welcome!")?;
    router.insert("/users/{id}", "A User")?;

    let matched = router.at("/users/978")?;
    assert_eq!(matched.params.get("id"), Some("978"));
    assert_eq!(*matched.value, "A User");

    Ok(())
}
```

## Parameters

The router supports dynamic route segments. These can either be named or catch-all parameters.

Named parameters like `/{id}` match anything until the next static segment or the end of the path.

```rust,ignore
let mut m = Router::new();
m.insert("/users/{id}", true)?;

assert_eq!(m.at("/users/1")?.params.get("id"), Some("1"));
assert_eq!(m.at("/users/23")?.params.get("id"), Some("23"));
assert!(m.at("/users").is_err());
```

Prefixes and suffixes within a segment are also supported. However, there may only be a single named parameter per route segment.
```rust,ignore
let mut m = Router::new();
m.insert("/images/img{id}.png", true)?;

assert_eq!(m.at("/images/img1.png")?.params.get("id"), Some("1"));
assert!(m.at("/images/img1.jpg").is_err());
```

Catch-all parameters start with `*` and match anything until the end of the path. They must always be at the **end** of the route.

```rust,ignore
let mut m = Router::new();
m.insert("/{*p}", true)?;

assert_eq!(m.at("/foo.js")?.params.get("p"), Some("foo.js"));
assert_eq!(m.at("/c/bar.css")?.params.get("p"), Some("c/bar.css"));

// Note that this would lead to an empty parameter.
assert!(m.at("/").is_err());
```

The literal characters `{` and `}` may be included in a static route by escaping them with the same character. For example, the `{` character is escaped with `{{` and the `}` character is escaped with `}}`.

```rust,ignore
let mut m = Router::new();
m.insert("/{{hello}}", true)?;
m.insert("/{hello}", true)?;

// Match the static route.
assert!(m.at("/{hello}")?.value);

// Match the dynamic route.
assert_eq!(m.at("/hello")?.params.get("hello"), Some("hello"));
```

## Routing Priority

Static and dynamic route segments are allowed to overlap. If they do, static segments will be given higher priority:

```rust,ignore
let mut m = Router::new();
m.insert("/", "Welcome!").unwrap();      // Priority: 1
m.insert("/about", "About Me").unwrap(); // Priority: 1
m.insert("/{*filepath}", "...").unwrap();  // Priority: 2
```

## How does it work?

The router takes advantage of the fact that URL routes generally follow a hierarchical structure. Routes are stored them in a radix trie that makes heavy use of common prefixes.

```text
Priority   Path             Value
9          \                1
3          ├s               None
2          |├earch\         2
1          |└upport\        3
2          ├blog\           4
1          |    └{post}     None
1          |          └\    5
2          ├about-us\       6
1          |        └team\  7
1          └contact\        8
```

This allows us to reduce the route search to a small number of branches. Child nodes on the same level of the tree are also prioritized
by the number of children with registered values, increasing the chance of choosing the correct branch of the first try.

## Benchmarks

As it turns out, this method of routing is extremely fast. In a benchmark matching 4 paths against 130 registered routes, `matchit` find the correct routes
in under 200 nanoseconds, an order of magnitude faster than most other routers. You can view the benchmark code [here](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/matchit/blob/master/benches/bench.rs).
